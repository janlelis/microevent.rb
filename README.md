# MicroEvent.rb [![[travis]](https://travis-ci.org/janlelis/microevent.rb.png)](https://travis-ci.org/janlelis/microevent.rb)

MicroEvent.rb is a event emitter library which provides the observer pattern to Ruby objects. It is inspired by [MicroEvent.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/microevent.js), implemented in less than [20 lines of Ruby](https://github.com/janlelis/microevent.rb/blob/master/lib/microevent.rb).


## Setup

Add to your `Gemfile`

```ruby
gem 'microevent'
```

or copy the [source file](https://github.com/janlelis/microevent.rb/blob/master/lib/microevent.rb) into your project.

## How to Use It

Suppose you got a class `Klass`, and you wish it to support the observer partern, do

```ruby
class Klass
  include MicroEvent
end
```

That's it. Now all instances of this class can `#bind`, `#unbind` and `trigger`:

```ruby
fn = proc{ puts "Go" }
object = Klass.new
object.bind :slot, &fn
object.trigger :slot # => Go
```

You could also use it on class/singleton level:

```ruby
class Klass
  extend MicroEvent
end

Klass.bind :slot do
  puts "Go"
end

Klass.trigger :slot # => Go
```

You will find more examples in the [tests](https://github.com/janlelis/microevent.rb/blob/master/spec/microevent_spec.rb).
